# Neo-Feed-Retrieve-a-list-of-Asteroids-based-on-their-closest-approach-date-to-Earth-

Retrieve a list of Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth. 

This application retrives the list of asteroids from NASA's Neo - Feed, sorted with respect to their relative velocity (in miles_per_hour).

This application retrieves the name of the asteroid with closest proximity to earth based on the data between the input date range.

The unit test cases are designed in order to make the application accurate and acceptable.

For running the application as well as test cases, run only one file named test_application.py.

For running just the application, use the file application.py.

Please use python 3.6.3.
